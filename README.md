# Positivity Place

## Creators: Yiling Kao and Ashley Chien

### When:

We created this project for CalHacks 4.0, which took place in October of 2017.

### What:

Positivity Place is a web app which allows users to relax in a positive and happy environment. The 
main feature of the website is a "Positivity Feed", where users can scroll through a "never-ending"
stream of positive images and quotes, all of which were scraped from websites such as BrainyQuote and Reddit!
Other pages of the website include an "About us", a "Games" page with embedded de-stressing games, 
an "Exercise" page with embdedded yoga videos and other exercise suggestions, a "Food" page with tools 
to find restaurants nearby, a "Vent Pillow" page to allow users to type their thoughts in, and an 
"Other" page which features our favorite ways to de-stress!

### How: 

Tools Used:
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- MongoDB/PyMongo

If you want to check out our web app, both PyMongo and Flask are required.
