# Positivity Place

## Creators: Yiling Kao and Ashley Chien

### When:

We created this project for CalHacks 4.0, which took place in October of 2017.

### Why:

Lots of college students are super stressed most or all of the time! We know this from personal experience and
from our friends. We wanted to make something that could help reduce stress and just make people.. happy :)

### What:

Positivity Place is a web app which allows users to relax in a positive and happy environment. The 
main feature of the website is a "Positivity Feed", where users can scroll through a "never-ending"
stream of positive images and quotes, all of which were scraped from websites such as BrainyQuote and Reddit!
Other pages of the website include an "About us", a "Games" page with embedded de-stressing games, 
an "Exercise" page with embdedded yoga videos and other exercise suggestions, a "Food" page with tools 
to find restaurants nearby, a "Vent Pillow" page to allow users to type their thoughts in, and an 
"Other" page which features our favorite ways to de-stress!

### How: 

Tools Used:
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- MongoDB/PyMongo

If you want to check out our web app, both PyMongo and Flask are required.

### The Future!
Other things that we wanted to include in the positivity feed, but didn't quite have time for:
- Survey/check-in: How are you feeling right now? 1 - 10 (Only ask one time per website click)
- More content, such as jokes, Youtube videos, happy news articles
- Option to include/exclude certain content using checkboxes
- Option to favorite/save/share content
